Hi!
I'm Kavya. I write software for a living, and am based in San Francisco.
I've primarily worked on "backend" systems and infrastructure, although I
recently switched to tinkering (professionally) with embedded systems and applications.
I currently work at Samsara.
In addition to building systems, I talk about them at conferences too.
I sometimes write about software, but admittedly less than I'd like to.
In my non-programmer life, I climb rocks and read books. I like eating pies too.
