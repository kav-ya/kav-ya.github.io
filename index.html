	  Hi!
	  I'm <span class="emphasis">kavya</span>.<br>
	  I write software for a living, and live in
	  foggy San Francisco.<br>
	  I've primarily worked on "backend" systems and infrastructure, although I
	  recently switched to professionally tinkering with embedded systems and applications.<br>
	  I currently work at <a href="https://medium.com/samsara-engineering/samsara-dev-spotlight-kavya-joshi-b939752df139">Samsara</a>.<br><br>
	  In addition to building systems, I <a href="#talks">talk about them</a> at conferences too.<br>
	  I sometimes <a href="#articles">write about software</a>, but admittedly less than I'd like to.<br><br>
	  In my non-programming life, I climb rocks and read books. I like eating pies too.

	  <li> <h3> Let's Talk Locks! </h3>
	    <p class="talkstract">
	      Locks have a bad rap for &quotbeing slow&quot and yet, they're used
	      extensively in applications and under-the-hood. So, what gives? <br>
	      This talk, given at QCon NYC and Istanbul Tech Talks, explored
	      when and why locks affect performance, delved into Go's lock implementation as a case study, and
	      discussed strategies to use when locks are actually a problem.

	  <li> <h3> The Scheduler Saga </h3>
	    <p class="talkstract">
	      The Go scheduler is, simply put, the orchestrator of the language runtime.
	      It schedules and unschedules goroutines, and also coordinates network polling and memory management. <br>
	      This GopherCon keynote explored the inner workings of the scheduler machinery.

	  <li> <h3> Applied Performance Theory </h3>
	    <p class="talkstract">
	      How does your system perform under load? What are the bottlenecks,
	      and how does it fail at its limits? How do you stay ahead as your system evolves and its workload grows?
	      Performance theory offers a rigorous and practical (-- yes!) approach to performance tuning and capacity planning. <br>
	      This talk, given at QCon London, Strange Loop, and Velocity
	      NYC, dived into elegant results like Little's Law and the
	      Universal Scalability Law, and explored how we might apply them to our systems.

	<ul>
	  <li> <h3> Understanding Channels </h3>
	    <p class="talkstract">
	    Go's channels provide a simple mechanism for goroutines to communicate,
	    and a powerful construct to build sophisticated concurrency
	    patterns. <br>
	    This GopherCon keynote delved into the inner workings of
	    channels and channel operations, including how they're supported by
	    the runtime scheduler.

	  <li> <h3> The Memory Chronicles: A Tale of Two Pythons </h3>
	    <p class="talkstract">
	    MicroPython is the leanest, meanest full Python
	    implementation. Designed for microcontrollers, this variant of
	    Python runs in less than 300KB of memory, _and_ retains support for all your favorite Python features. <br>
	    So what does it take to make the smallest Python? Put differently, why does CPython have a large memory footprint? <br>
	    This talk, given at PyCon, explored the internals of MicroPython and
	    contrasted it with CPython, focusing on the aspects that relate to
	    memory use.

	  <li> <h3> A Tale of Concurrency through Creativity in Python: A Deep
	      Dive into Gevent </h3>
	    <p class="talkstract">
	      gevent is an open source Python library for asynchronous I/O. It
	      provides a powerful construct to build concurrent applications;
	      think threads, except lightweight and cooperatively scheduled. <br>
	      This talk, given at PyCon, delved into how gevent is architected
	      from its building blocks -- sophisticated coroutines, an event
	      loop, and a dash of creativity to neatly integrate them.
